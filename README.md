# Excel-Assignment-Organizer

I created this program using Python and the Pandas library. Its purpose is to add data to an Excel spreadsheet. This is a simple program, making it an ideal starting point for learning Pandas. You can copy the code and customize it to suit your needs. I developed this project to help me stay organized with my school assignments, but feel free to modify it to your liking.
